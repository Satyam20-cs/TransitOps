# Introduction

TransitOps is a full-stack fleet management system designed to help logistics companies efficiently manage their transportation operations.

Instead of maintaining multiple spreadsheets and manual registers for vehicles, drivers, fuel logs, maintenance records and trips, TransitOps provides one centralized dashboard for complete operational visibility.

The system supports multiple user roles with secure authentication and authorization while providing business insights through analytics and reporting dashboards.

---

# Problem Statement

Fleet management companies face several operational challenges:

- Vehicle utilization is difficult to track.
- Drivers are assigned manually.
- Trips are difficult to monitor.
- Maintenance schedules are often missed.
- Fuel expenses increase due to poor monitoring.
- Business reports require manual calculations.
- No centralized operational dashboard.

These inefficiencies result in:

- Increased operational cost
- Delayed deliveries
- Higher maintenance expenses
- Poor decision making
- Lack of accountability

---

# Solution

TransitOps digitizes the complete transportation workflow.

The application enables organizations to:

- Manage vehicles
- Manage drivers
- Create and dispatch trips
- Track maintenance
- Record fuel usage
- Monitor expenses
- Generate analytics
- Export reports

Everything is accessible through a secure role-based dashboard.
